Welcome back friends!

We've added some new functionality to our app!

As you can see, when I click on a shape, it gets deleted
So now I have an exercise for you. 

1) Write a test that renders out a red circle and a pink square.
2) Simulate clicking on the red circle and pink square, and assert that they both disappeared.
